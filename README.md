# spring-boot-rest-api-couchbase-crud
Spring Boot REST APIs with CRUD for Couchbase. 

Branches:

-**basic_crud**: contains basic REST APIs with CRUD for Couchbase

-**transactions_implementations**: REST APIs with transactions

The APIs work fine but some tests may fail randomly if you run them altogheter. I am trying to solve the issue.

I have experienced some issue with some methods of the CouchbaseTemplate and also extending the CrudRepository so I have tried other ways to produce methods that work.

If you have any suggestions or thoughts feel free to contact me.
