# spring-boot-rest-api-couchbase-crud
Spring Boot REST APIs with CRUD for Couchbase. 

Branches:

-**basic_crud**: contains basic REST APIs with CRUD for Couchbase
-**transactions_implementations**: REST APIs with transactions

Some tests may fail randomly it is a issue I am trying to solve. 
I could have used the couchbaseTemplate method to write the transactions but I have experienced some issue with them.

If you have any suggestions or thoughts feel free to contact me.
